<h3><b>Introduction to Keto BHB</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keto BHB, short for Beta-Hydroxybutyrate, is a type of exogenous ketone supplement that is designed to help individuals achieve and maintain a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state in which the body switches from using carbohydrates as its primary fuel source to using fat for energy. This shift in fuel source can lead to weight loss and other health benefits.</span>
<h3><b>What is Keto BHB?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keto BHB supplements typically contain BHB salts, which are ketones that are chemically bound to minerals such as sodium, calcium, or magnesium. These BHB salts are thought to mimic the ketones produced by the body during periods of fasting or carbohydrate restriction, helping to induce ketosis more quickly and effectively.</span>
<h3><b>How does Keto BHB work?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you consume Keto BHB supplements, the BHB salts are absorbed into the bloodstream and transported to the liver, where they are converted into ketones. These ketones can then be used by the body as a source of energy, particularly by the brain, muscles, and other tissues.</span>
